# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive role-based access control system implemented in the EMS (Enterprise Management System) to ensure that:

- **Admins** can see and manage all visitors, enquiries, and analytics
- **Executives** can only see and manage their assigned visitors and enquiries
- **JWT role checks** are applied consistently across all backend routes
- **Data filtering** is enforced at the database level for security

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization Flow

### JWT Token Structure
```javascript
{
  "id": "user_id_here",
  "role": "admin" | "executive",
  "username": "username_here",
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

### Middleware Chain
```javascript
// Standard middleware chain for protected routes
authenticateToken → addUserContext → enforceExecutiveAccess → requireAdminOrExecutive
```

### User Context Object
```javascript
req.userContext = {
  isAdmin: boolean,
  isExecutive: boolean,
  userId: string,
  userRole: 'admin' | 'executive',
  canAccessAll: boolean
}
```

## 🛡️ Role-Based Filtering Implementation

### 1. **Dashboard Analytics** (`GET /api/analytics/dashboard`)

**Admin Access:**
- Sees all visitors, enquiries, messages, FAQs, and articles
- No filtering applied

**Executive Access:**
- Only sees visitors and enquiries assigned to them
- Messages, FAQs, and articles remain global (read-only)

```javascript
// Role-based filters
const visitorFilter = req.userContext.isExecutive ? 
  { assignedAgent: req.userContext.userId } : {};
const enquiryFilter = req.userContext.isExecutive ? 
  { assignedAgent: req.userContext.userId } : {};
```

### 2. **Visitors Management** (`GET /api/analytics/visitors-management`)

**Admin Access:**
- Sees all visitors with full pagination and filtering
- Can search, filter by status/source, and view all data

**Executive Access:**
- Only sees visitors assigned to them
- Same pagination and filtering capabilities, but limited to their data

```javascript
// Role-based filtering
if (req.userContext.isExecutive) {
  query.assignedAgent = req.userContext.userId;
}
// Admins see all visitors (no additional filtering)
```

### 3. **Enquiries Management** (`GET /api/analytics/enquiries-management`)

**Admin Access:**
- Sees all enquiries with full pagination and filtering
- Can search, filter by status/enquiry type, and view all data

**Executive Access:**
- Only sees enquiries assigned to them
- Same pagination and filtering capabilities, but limited to their data

```javascript
// Role-based filtering
if (req.userContext.isExecutive) {
  query.assignedAgent = req.userContext.userId;
}
// Admins see all enquiries (no additional filtering)
```

### 4. **Agent Performance** (`GET /api/analytics/agent-performance`)

**Admin Access:**
- Sees performance data for all executives
- Can compare performance across the team

**Executive Access:**
- Only sees their own performance data
- Cannot view other executives' performance

```javascript
if (req.userContext.isExecutive) {
  // Executives only see their own performance
  executives = await User.find({ _id: req.userContext.userId, role: 'executive' }).lean();
} else {
  // Admins see all executives
  executives = await User.find({ role: 'executive' }).lean();
}
```

## 🔒 Access Control on CRUD Operations

### 1. **Update Visitor Status** (`PUT /api/analytics/update-visitor-status`)

**Access Control:**
- **Admin:** Can update any visitor's status
- **Executive:** Can only update visitors assigned to them

```javascript
// Role-based access control
if (req.userContext.isExecutive && visitor.assignedAgent?.toString() !== req.userContext.userId) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'You can only update visitors assigned to you' });
}
```

### 2. **Update Enquiry** (`PUT /api/analytics/update-enquiry`)

**Access Control:**
- **Admin:** Can update any enquiry
- **Executive:** Can only update enquiries assigned to them

```javascript
// Role-based access control
if (req.userContext.isExecutive && enquiry.assignedAgent?.toString() !== req.userContext.userId) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'You can only update enquiries assigned to you' });
}
```

### 3. **Delete Enquiry** (`DELETE /api/analytics/delete-enquiry/:enquiryId`)

**Access Control:**
- **Admin:** Can delete any enquiry
- **Executive:** Can only delete enquiries assigned to them

```javascript
// Role-based access control
if (req.userContext.isExecutive && enquiry.assignedAgent?.toString() !== req.userContext.userId) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'You can only delete enquiries assigned to you' });
}
```

### 4. **View Visitor Pipeline** (`GET /api/analytics/visitor-pipeline/:visitorId`)

**Access Control:**
- **Admin:** Can view any visitor's pipeline history
- **Executive:** Can only view pipeline history for visitors assigned to them

```javascript
// Role-based access control
if (req.userContext.isExecutive && visitor.assignedAgent?.toString() !== req.userContext.userId) {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'You can only view visitors assigned to you' });
}
```

## 🤖 Automatic Assignment System

### Chatbot Enquiry Creation
When a visitor creates an enquiry through the chatbot, the system automatically assigns it to an available executive:

```javascript
// Find available executive for assignment (round-robin)
const executives = await User.find({ role: 'executive' }).lean();
let assignedAgent = null;

if (executives.length > 0) {
  // Simple round-robin assignment - can be enhanced with load balancing
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * executives.length);
  assignedAgent = executives[randomIndex]._id;
}

// Update visitor and enquiry with assigned agent
if (assignedAgent) {
  visitor.assignedAgent = assignedAgent;
  enquiry.assignedAgent = assignedAgent;
}
```

### Manual Enquiry Creation
When an admin or executive manually creates an enquiry:

```javascript
// Get current user for assignment
const user = await User.findById(req.user.id).lean();
const assignedAgent = user?.role === 'executive' ? req.user.id : null;

// Create enquiry with assignment
const newEnquiry = new Enquiry({
  // ... other fields
  assignedAgent, // Automatically assigned to creating executive
});
```

## 📊 Response Format with User Context

All protected endpoints now return user context information:

```javascript
{
  // ... actual data
  userContext: {
    role: 'admin' | 'executive',
    canAccessAll: boolean
  }
}
```

This allows the frontend to:
- Display appropriate UI elements based on user role
- Show/hide features based on permissions
- Provide user feedback about their access level

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Middleware Functions

#### `addUserContext`
Adds user context information to the request object for easy access throughout the request lifecycle.

#### `enforceExecutiveAccess`
Sets access control flags based on user role to ensure consistent enforcement.

#### `requireAdminOrExecutive`
Validates that the user has the required role to access the endpoint.

### Database Queries
All database queries are filtered at the query level, ensuring that:
- No sensitive data is ever retrieved from the database
- Performance is optimized by filtering at the source
- Security is enforced at the data layer

### Error Handling
Consistent error messages for access violations:
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing token
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found or not accessible

## 🚀 Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Security**: Data is filtered at the database level, preventing unauthorized access
2. **Performance**: Only relevant data is retrieved, improving query performance
3. **Scalability**: Role-based filtering scales with the number of users
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized middleware makes it easy to modify access rules
5. **Consistency**: All endpoints follow the same access control patterns
6. **Auditability**: All access attempts are logged and can be tracked

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

- Legacy endpoints (`/executive-visitors-management`, `/executive-enquiries-management`) are maintained for backward compatibility
- They now redirect to the main endpoints with proper role-based filtering
- Existing frontend code will continue to work without modification

## 📝 Future Enhancements

1. **Load Balancing**: Implement more sophisticated assignment algorithms for executives
2. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive audit trails for all access attempts
3. **Dynamic Permissions**: Allow fine-grained permission control beyond just admin/executive roles
4. **Caching**: Implement role-based caching for improved performance
5. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for real-time data updates based on user role

This implementation provides a robust, secure, and scalable role-based access control system that ensures data privacy while maintaining system performance and usability.
